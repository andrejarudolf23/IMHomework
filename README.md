After cloning the project, in order to run it navigate to project root folder path and run npm install command. 
After that you will be able to run the app with command 'npm start' and access it on port 3000, localhost:3000.
In order to start the worker, you need to create a file called config.json and put it the project root path/worker folder. Please ping me so I can provide you with the content of config.json. 
After that, you should be able to start the worker by going to the project root folder path and running command npm run worker. EDIT: port has been changed to 4020 due to some issues on 3000.
